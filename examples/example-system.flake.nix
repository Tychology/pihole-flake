## This is an example flake-based NixOS configuration to show the use of the pihole-flake.
## The configuration is not complete and it is assumed that a `./configuration.nix` and `./hardware.nix` exists.
## The example will start Pi-hole in an unprivileged container and expose the DNS & web services on unpriviledged ports.
